Hello!


I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of experience. I work in fields like REST-APIs, web scraping and machine learning using 
technologies such as python (flask and fastAPI frameworks), SQL, selenium, bs4, web stack (JS, HTML and CSS), 
scikit-learn and pyspark for ML tasks.

I also have experience in cloud technologies such as AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

Previously I created a telehealth startup called T20Med that connected self-employed doctors and patients via a mobile app
and web platform. Now, I work as a full-time software engineer in other company.
